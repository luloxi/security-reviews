# Lulox's Security Reviews

Here you will find some security reviews I have done. I will try to keep this updated with the latest reviews I do.

Some PDFs have been done following [Cyfrin's security and auditing course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUWmJ86X_do) lesson. I highly recommend it. It's a great course to learn about security, auditing, and report making, and it's free!

I also included the [files I use with templating](./audit-template/) for converting markdown to PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes). Feel free to reuse them as you see fit.
