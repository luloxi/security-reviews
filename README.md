# Lulox's security reviews

Here you will find some security reviews I have done. I will try to keep this updated with the latest reviews I do.

Some PDFs have been done following [Cyfrin's security and auditing course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUWmJ86X_do) lesson. I highly recommend it.

I also included the files I use with templating for converting markdown to PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Feel free to reuse them as you see fit.
