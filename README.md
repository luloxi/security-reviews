# Lulox's security reviews

So far this repo consists of security reviews done following [Cyfrin's security reviewers course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUWmJ86X_do), but in the future it's intended to hold all the security reviews done while participating in competitive audits and/or as a private auditor (with permission by clients) to showcase my auditing skills.
